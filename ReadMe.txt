Software tool that cross-references a user-provided text document against a dictionary file to identify any incorrect spellings. 
The program will request the user to input the filenames for both the text document and the dictionary file. 
In the event that a file isn't found, the user will be prompted to re-enter the filename.
It will print the misspelled words and count them.
